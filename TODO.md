TODO:
- Monitor directories for added files (See: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/notification.html)
- NAS (very basic hashtable structure for storing IP Addresses of connected hosts)
- Query for capacity (setup involves setting a capacity for how much space the app can use)
- Highest capacity == Master (reflected in the NAS)
- Design file system data structure that can be shared between nodes
  - Leaves are files, which must be created (either the whole file, or a temp file (abc.jpeg.remote)
- Pull requests (all types of requests)
- Message passing for creation/deletion/modification of files

If Time Permits:
- LRU Cache Algorithm
